# ChatGPT UI (placeholder)

This directory will host the Next.js app (Vercel ChatGPT Apps starter fork).

Decisions applied:
- Canvas Option B: richer visual cards (thumbnail + sensory icons + metadata).
- Public Option B: support for authors with lightweight accounts and follows; public pages resolve via memory slugs.

Next steps (to be implemented):
- `/api/mcp` handler (Node shim) â†’ forwards to FastAPI.
- Inline Weaver card + fullscreen Sea components.
- Public mirror routes for slugs (viewer-only for now).
