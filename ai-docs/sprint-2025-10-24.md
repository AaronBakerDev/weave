# Sprint: October 24 2025

- **Start:** 2025-10-24
- **Target end:** 2025-11-01
- **Theme:** Stabilize local dev tooling and align documentation with current implementation.

## Objectives
1. Restore ChatGPT UI dev server reliability by fixing Tailwind/PostCSS configuration.
2. Improve onboarding by updating documentation for Docker-less setups and reflecting completed functionality.
3. Complete outstanding search/indexing enhancements to match the hybrid scoring spec.
4. Capture work session outcomes consistently in `worklog/`.

## Backlog

| Priority | Item | Notes | Owner |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| P0 | Install `@tailwindcss/postcss`, regenerate PostCSS config, and verify Next.js dev build | ✅ Built successfully with Node v22.18.0 (PATH adjusted to prefer `~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.18.0/bin`) | Done |
| P0 | Document non-Docker Postgres setup + refresh README/doc.md status tables | ✅ README/doc updated 2025-10-24 | Done |
| P1 | Implement edge-boost term in search hybrid score | ✅ Added CTE-based boost using `memory_edge`; needs real-data tuning | Done |
| P1 | Wire enqueue for non-text layer indexing or remove TODO | ✅ Non-text layers now enqueue `memory_event` | Done |
| P1 | Run/record FastAPI integration tests against local Postgres | ✅ PYTHONPATH=. DATABASE_URL=postgresql://weave_user:weave_password@localhost:5433/weave pytest services/api/tests/test_api.py | Done |
| P2 | Update sprint log after each working block | Ongoing entries in `worklog/` | Ongoing |

## Risks & Notes
- Tailwind/PostCSS upgrade friction may require additional dependency pinning.
- Local Postgres instructions must account for pgvector extension availability.
- Search tuning depends on real data; may need test fixtures or mocks.
- Current Node.js version on dev host is 18.15.0; Next.js build requires ≥18.17.0 for verification runs.

## Definition of Done
- UI dev server boots cleanly without manual intervention.
- README and doc.md accurately reflect implemented endpoints/features as of 2025-10-24.
- Search endpoint returns non-zero edge boost and passes updated tests.
- Worklog contains dated entries for each session during this sprint.
